# Python and R

Python and R are two different yet similar languages. I would say that if you want to try and interpret data and present it in a visually appealing and igestible way then use R, but python definetily has more capabilites and options to do other things with. One fun fact is that R and python can work together to generate data and results. In the example below, I loaded the datasets "quakes" and generated a histogram in an r code chunk; however when interpreting (Calculating for mean) I used a python code, and I was stillable to gernerate results! I like to think of it as 2 different paths to get the same results, because you can visualize data in r and python, but the codes used to generate them slightly vary from one another. 

```{r}
quakes<-quakes
hist(quakes$mag)
```

```{python}
r.quakes.mag.mean()
```

Something really cool you can do with python and R is save two different variables in the r format then in a python format and have th print out together! For me, this is really interestng because its like how we speak two different languages. I speak vietnamese and english, so when I'm at home, I speak mostly vietnamese to my parents, but of course I slip up and sprinkle in some engish in mysentences. My parents are still ble to understand me even though their english isn't the best. This example is how i picture r and python. They are able to understand eachother and generate results and outputs. In the example below, I saved a variable in r and another in python, but I printed them both out in python, and of course just like how my dad was able to understand my english, python understands the r code and is able to generate the output that I requested! 

```{r}
library(reticulate)
im<-"Lets go get some food before I lose mmy mind"
```

```{python}
hungry="I was thinking Thai food!"
print(r.im,hungry)
```
